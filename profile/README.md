## 🤝 Contributions

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the heart of Rypî and fundamental to how we build software/web apps today. See for yourself:

<!-- Listing github repositories and shed the light on contributions (see old commits) -->

Now that we've talked about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [How To Contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

<!-- Tell the developer that there are code conventions and patterns for each repository.
	 List the common tools for formatting and linting -->

### 👓 Contributors
