## 🤝 Contributions

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the heart of Rypî and fundamental to how we build software/web apps today. See for yourself:

<!-- Listing github repositories and shed the light on contributions (see old commits) -->

<!-- See what's next on our [public roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap) ✨ and [let us know](https://github.com/github/feedback) if you have any suggestions 🙇‍♂️. Oh, and by the way, we are always hiring talented, passionate people to [join our team](https://github.com/about/careers) 🙌. -->

Now that we've talked about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [How To Contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

<!-- Tell the developer that there are code conventions and patterns for each repository. List the common tools for formatting and linting -->
